#Sonar Dataset Analysis and Rock/Mine Classification
This repository contains a Python script that analyzes the Sonar dataset and builds a predictive model to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signals.

Objective: The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of building a machine learning model for classification tasks.
Dataset: The Sonar dataset consists of sonar signals bounced off various objects in the ocean. Each object is labeled as either a rock (R) or a mine (M).
Model: We utilize logistic regression for classification, a simple yet effective algorithm suitable for labeled data.

Contents
sonar_data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
sonar_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data processing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

Instructions
To run the analysis and classification:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn).
Open and run the sonar_classification.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook to analyze the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
Feel free to tweak parameters, try different algorithms, or further explore the data for deeper insights.

Results
Training Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 83.42% on the training data.
Testing Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 76.19% on the testing data.
Predictive System: A predictive system is implemented to classify new sonar signals as either rocks or mines.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for classification tasks using the Sonar dataset. The trained model can effectively classify objects based on sonar signals, with promising accuracy on both training and testing data.
